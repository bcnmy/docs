# Organization Overview

The organization feature is designed to enhance collaboration and streamline team management within your workspace.
This feature allows you to invite new team members to your organization and manage their access permissions. Whether you're looking to onboard new hires, collaborate with external partners, or reorganize teams, this feature was designed to provide you with a seamless management experience.

## Inviting Team Members

Inviting colleagues to join your organization is straightforward. Follow these simple steps to send an invitation:

1. Click on the user settings dropdown and select 'Account Settings'.

2. Navigate to 'Team' page.

3. Click on '+ Invite User' button.

4. Enter the email address of the individuals you wish to invite.

5. Select the appropriate role from the predefined list to ensure each team member receives the access they require.

6. Send the invitation by clicking the 'Invite' button.
   You can invite more team members at once by clicking '+ Add More' and following steps 4 to 6.

Once invited, team members will receive an email with a link to join the organization.
They will need to follow the link to set up their account and gain access to the resources permitted by their assigned role.

## Role Permissions

Roles are defined as follows:

- `Admin`: Admins have full access to all settings and features, including the ability to invite new members, change any memberâ€™s role, manage permissions, and view and edit all projects and financial settings.

- `Editor`: Editors can access and modify all projects and settings except for team member management. This role is suited for team members who need to make substantial contributions to projects but do not need control over user roles and permissions.

- `Viewer`: Viewers have read-only access to all projects, meaning they cannot alter any project content. However, Viewers can deposit funds into the paymaster account, supporting financial operations without modifying project data.

## Changing User Roles

Adjusting the roles of existing team members is a critical part of managing your organization's operations efficiently. Whether you need to upgrade a team member's access due to a change in responsibilities or downgrade access as part of a security protocol, our system provides a straightforward process for modifying user roles.

Steps to Change User Role:

1. Click on the user settings dropdown and select 'Account Settings'.

2. Navigate to 'Team' page.

3. Find the team member whose role you want to change.

4. Click on the user's current role displayed next to their status and select the new role you wish to assign to the user.
