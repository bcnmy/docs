title: ERC-7677: Paymaster Web Service Capability

---

The Biconomy Paymaster supports ERC-7677 standard, which is an [EIP-5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792) compliant capability for paymasters
to standarize the interaction between wallets and ERC-4337 paymaster web servic.es

You can read more about ERC-7677 [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677).

:::info
The current support of ERC-7677 is only for Entry Point v6, deployed at: 0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789
:::

:::info
Currently the Biconomy SDK does not support 7677 capabilities. You can either directly interact with
Biconomy Paymaster Service using JSON RPC calls as described in the upcoming sections
or refer to [this playground](https://github.com/arcticfloyd1984/7677-playground) that uses
Safe Smart Account with Pimlico's permissionless.js SDK's 7677 paymaster client to send user operation
