The Biconomy Paymaster allows you to have a single paymaster URL generated on our dashboard, which can be used for gas sponsorship as well as enabling users to pay gas in ERC20 tokens. 
Instead of keeping multiple paymaster URLs to differentiate the paymaster type, the API request body now includes a MODE parameter which will be sent to indicate whether the dApp wants sponsored transactions for its users or wants to enable ERC20 payments by users.

You can get your Paymaster URL from the Biconomy [Dashboard](https://dashboard.biconomy.io/). 
This is the same endpoint URL used for all requests. 
All requests must follow the [JSON RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specifications.

:::info
This documentation is for using our Paymaster APIs directly. 
If you are building with the Biconomy SDK you can follow the instructions on this [page](/Paymaster/paymastermethods).

You can test these endpoints on our [Paymaster Explorer](/Paymaster/api/explorer)
