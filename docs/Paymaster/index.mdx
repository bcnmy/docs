Paymasters are smart contracts that help facilitate transaction sponsorship, allowing third-party-designed mechanisms to pay for transactions.
With Biconomy's Paymaster service, you can manage gas fees for your users effortlessly.

**Revenue sharing**: on a case-by-case basis depending on volumes, we do offer a split of the Paymaster fee revenue with selected Apps.

In order to use the it, you must [setup the paymaster](/dashboard/paymaster) on the dashboard and obtain the paymasterURL. Biconomy paymaster supports two modes:

## Sponsorship Paymaster

![Sponsored](../images/overview/sponsored.png)

`Sponsorship` mode allows you to pay gas on behalf of the users, by eliminating the need of native tokens to be paid by the users. 

## Token Paymaster

![Erc20](../images/overview/erc20gas.png)

`ERC20` mode allows you to pay for the gas fees of your users in exchange for ERC-20 tokens. Check out the latest [supported ERC-20 tokens](/paymaster/supportedNetworks).
