# Bundler Methods

Following are the methods that can be called on bundler instance

:::note

When using these methods you will need to create a `userOp`. The [accounts methods](/account/methods) will help you in creating these for the paymaster methods below.

:::

## [sendUserOp](https://bcnmy.github.io/biconomy-client-sdk/classes/Bundler.html#sendUserOp)

Although the Bundler has the sendUserOp method for sending a userOp to be mined on chain this is not something you would need to call yourself as it would be done when sending the userOp from the smart account. For a full rundown of this process [click here](/account/methods#senduserop).

## [getUserOpReceipt](https://bcnmy.github.io/biconomy-client-sdk/classes/Bundler.html#getUserOpReceipt)

After using `sendUserOp` you will recieve a `userOpResponse` which contains a string clled `userOpHash`

Using this `userOpHash` you can fetch the `userOpReceipt` which verifies that your `userOp` was handled on chain as a transaction.

```ts
const userOpReceipt = await getUserOpReceipt("0x....");
```

The full UserOpReceipt object type is shown below:

```ts
type UserOpReceipt = {
  userOpHash: string;
  entryPoint: string;
  sender: string;
  nonce: number;
  paymaster: string;
  actualGasCost: BigNumber;
  actualGasUsed: BigNumber;
  success: boolean;
  reason: string;
  logs: Array<ethers.providers.Log>;
  receipt: ethers.providers.TransactionReceipt;
};
```

## [getUserOpByHash](https://bcnmy.github.io/biconomy-client-sdk/classes/Bundler.html#getUserOpByHash)

After using `sendUserOp` you will recieve a `userOpResponse` which contains a string clled `userOpHash`

Using this `userOpHash` you can fetch the original `userOp` that was created with this hash.

```ts
const userOp = await getUserOpByHash("0x...");
```

The userOperation will contain the followin values:

```ts
type BytesLike = Bytes | string;
type BigNumberish = BigNumber | Bytes | bigint | string | number;

type UserOperation = {
  sender: string;
  nonce: BigNumberish;
  initCode: BytesLike;
  callData: BytesLike;
  callGasLimit: BigNumberish;
  verificationGasLimit: BigNumberish;
  preVerificationGas: BigNumberish;
  maxFeePerGas: BigNumberish;
  maxPriorityFeePerGas: BigNumberish;
  paymasterAndData: BytesLike;
  signature: BytesLike;
};
```

Additionally this response will contain the following:

```ts
type UserOpByHashResponse = UserOperation & {
  transactionHash: string;
  blockNumber: number;
  blockHash: string;
  entryPoint: string;
};
```
