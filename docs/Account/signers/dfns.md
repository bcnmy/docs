# DFNS

Dfns provides wallet-as-a-service infrastructure that enables crypto developers to forget about private key management so they can focus on building what matters most â€” their applications. This guide will show you how to create a smart account using DFNS as a signer.

:::tip

Check out an end-to-end integration of DFNS with Biconomy on this [repo](https://github.com/dfnsext/typescript-sdk/tree/m/examples/ethersjs/v5/biconomy-aa-gasless)!

:::

Before using the code in this guide you will need to onboard onto DFNS, check out their onboarding guide [here](https://docs.dfns.co/dfns-docs/getting-started/gettingstarted).

Code snippets below will be taken from the repository mentioned above and include some environment variables you will be able to fill in. The example will follow a node js script but can be adopted for frontend frameworks as well.

The first thing we need to do is generate a DFNS wallet. Let's take a look at the imports and then the code for generating the wallet.

## Imports

```typescript
import { createSmartAccountClient, LightSigner } from "@biconomy/account";
import { DfnsWallet } from "@dfns/lib-ethersjs5";
import { DfnsApiClient } from "@dfns/sdk";
import { AsymmetricKeySigner } from "@dfns/sdk-keysigner";
import { Interface } from "@ethersproject/abi";
import { JsonRpcProvider } from "@ethersproject/providers";
import dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();
```

## Generate DFNS Wallet

```typescript
const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(process.env.POLYGON_PROVIDER_URL);

const initDfnsWallet = (walletId: string, provider: JsonRpcProvider) => {
  const signer = new AsymmetricKeySigner({
    privateKey: process.env.DFNS_PRIVATE_KEY!,
    credId: process.env.DFNS_CRED_ID!,
    appOrigin: process.env.DFNS_APP_ORIGIN!,
  });

  const dfnsClient = new DfnsApiClient({
    appId: process.env.DFNS_APP_ID!,
    authToken: process.env.DFNS_AUTH_TOKEN!,
    baseUrl: process.env.DFNS_API_URL!,
    signer,
  });

  return new DfnsWallet({
    walletId,
    dfnsClient,
    maxRetries: 10,
  }).connect(provider);
};

const mumbaiWallet = initDfnsWallet(process.env.POLYGON_WALLET_ID!, provider);
```

Remember to get your API keys from the DFNS dashboard and follow their [getting started](https://docs.dfns.co/dfns-docs/getting-started/gettingstarted) guides for this part of the process.

## Create Smart Account

```typescript
const createAccount = async (): Promise<BiconomySmartAccountV2> =>
  createSmartAccountClient({
    signer: mumbaiWallet as LightSigner,
    bundlerUrl: "", // <-- Read about this at https://docs.biconomy.io/dashboard#bundler-url
    biconomyPaymasterApiKey: "", // <-- Read about at https://docs.biconomy.io/dashboard/paymaster
  });
```

You can get all paymaster and bundler URLs from your [Biconomy Dashboard](https://dashboard.biconomy.io/) for this step.

With this integration you will have everything you need to begin using the Biconomy Smart Account with DFNS. Remember to check out the [full integration here](https://github.com/dfnsext/typescript-sdk/tree/m/examples/ethersjs/v5/biconomy-aa-gasless) to see this in action with an example that includes executing a gasless transaction as well.
