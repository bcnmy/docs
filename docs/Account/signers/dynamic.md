Dynamic.xyz is a web3 login solution for everyone, offering straightforward onboarding and embedded wallet options for newcomers and elegant and smart login flows for crypto-native users. We aim to abstract away the complexities of user management, offering powerful developer tools around authentication, authorization and onboarding.

## 1. Install Dynamic and Biconomy

In your app's repository, install `@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core`, `@dynamic-labs/ethereum` and `@biconomy/account`:

```bash

yarn add @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core @biconomy/account

```

:::tip
@dynamic-labs/ethereum will help you to enable all EVM compatible chains including layer 2â€™s i.e. Base as well as Dynamic Embedded Wallets. Learn more about WalletConnectors [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/components/dynamiccontextprovider#walletconnectors).
:::

## 2. Initialize & configure Dynamic

### 2a. Add the DynamicContextProvider

All you need to get started is [the DynamicContextProvider](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/components/dynamiccontextprovider) - you will want to wrap your app with this component at the highest possible level, like so:

```tsx
import { DynamicContextProvider } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from "@dynamic-labs/ethereum";
import { EthersExtension } from "@dynamic-labs/ethers-v6";

<DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    // Find your environment id at https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/developer
    environmentId: "REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-ID",
    walletConnectors: [EthereumWalletConnectors],
    walletConnectorExtensions: [EthersExtension],
  }}
>
  {/* Your app's components */}
</DynamicContextProvider>;
```

:::tip
We are using Ethers here instead of the default Viem, as Biconomy requires an Ethers signer object. Learn more about switching between Viem and Ethers [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/viem-ethers).
:::

:::tip
To enable embedded wallets for your users, toggle it on along with email/social auth [in the dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/configurations#emailsocialsignin).
:::

### 2b. Access the wallet

Inside any component which is wrapped by DynamicContextProvider, you can access any of [the provided hooks](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/hooks/hooks-introduction). While you can access the full context via [usedynamiccontext](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/hooks/usedynamiccontext), we are most interested in the users currently connected wallets which we can easily access via [useuserwallets](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/react-sdk/hooks/useuserwallets).

:::tip
A user can have branded wallets connected as well as Dynamic embedded wallets, so here we will filter for a users embedded wallet, assuming they had one created when they signed up.
:::

```tsx
import { useUserWallets } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core";

const userWallets = useUserWallets();

const embeddedWallet = userWallets.find(
  (wallet) => wallet.connector?.isEmbeddedWallet === true
);
```

## 3. Configure your Biconomy bundler and paymaster

Go to the [Biconomy Dashboard](https://dashboard.biconomy.io/) and configure a Paymaster and a Bundler for your app. Make sure these correspond to the desired network for your user's smart accounts. You can learn more about the dashboard [here](/dashboard)

## 4. Create the smart account

Lastly, using the user's paymaster, bundler, and validation module instances from above, initialize the user's smart account using Biconomy's `createSmartAccountClient` method:

```tsx

...

// Note that we are using the ethers signer here rather than Viem
const signer = await embeddedWallet.connector?.ethers?.getSigner();

const smartAccount = await createSmartAccountClient({
  signer,
  bundlerUrl: "", // get from biconomy dashboard https://dashboard.biconomy.io/
  biconomyPaymasterApiKey: "", // Biconomy Paymaster API Key can also be obtained from dashboard
});

```

## End to end flow
