The SDK provides the following API methods for a smart account.

### createSmartAccountClient

This method is used to create an instance of the Biconomy Smart Account. This method requires a smart account configuration object to be passed and returns the smart account API instance.

This method creates the smart account based on the config object. To configure a smart account on another chain, you need to instantiate another smart account API instance with configuration of that chain.

**Usage**

```jsx
let provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("rpcUrl");
let signer = new ethers.Wallet("private key", provider);

const smartAccount = await createSmartAccountClient({
  signer,
  bundlerUrl: "", // <-- Read about this at https://docs.biconomy.io/dashboard#bundler-url
  biconomyPaymasterApiKey: "", // <-- Read about at https://docs.biconomy.io/dashboard/paymaster
});
```

**Parameters**

_required params are explicitly mentioned_

- config (`object`, required): A [BiconomySmartAccountConfig](https://bcnmy.github.io/biconomy-client-sdk/classes/BiconomySmartAccountV2.html#biconomySmartAccountConfig) object containing configuration options for creating the smart account.
  - signer(`Signer`, required) OR defaultValidationModule (`BaseValidationModule`, required): One either needs to pass the signer instance or the default validation module which gets used to detect address of the smart account. If not passed explictly, ECDSA module gets used as default.
  - bundlerUrl (`string`, required) OR bundler (`IBundler`, required) : bundler url which will be internally used to create bundler instance or the bundler instance. Bundler instance can also be used if one wants to customise the bundler. Refer to bundler [integration](/bundler/integration) for more details on bundler.
  - chainId (`ChainId` enum): The identifier for the blockchain network. (e.g., ChainId.POLYGON_MUMBAI).
  - biconomyPaymasterApiKey(`string`) OR paymaster (`IPaymaster`): one can either pass paymaster API key or custom paymaster instance to use the paymaster.
  - entryPointAddress (`string`): DEFAULT_ENTRY_POINT_ADDRESS will be used if not passed, otherwise the passed address will be used. On specific chains like Chiliz Mainnet it is a different address, so will need to be passed explicitly. Refer to below notes on this.
  - activeValidationModule (`BaseValidationModule`): The run-time validation module (must be one of enabled validation modules) to sign and validate next userOp.
  - rpcUrl (`string`): RPC URL of the chain
  - index (`number`): index to create multiple smart accounts for an EOA

**Returns**

- `smartAccount` (`BiconomySmartAccount`): An instance of the Biconomy Smart Account.

## Smart Account Get Methods

### getAccountAddress( )

This method retrieves the counterfactual address of the `smartAccount` instance.

**Usage**

```jsx
const address = await smartAccount.getAccountAddress();
```

**Returns**

- address (`Promise<string>`): A Promise resolving to the account address associated with the smartAccount instance.

### getNonce( )

This method is used to retrieve the nonce associated with the `smartAccount` instance.

**Usage**

```jsx
const nonce = await smartAccount.getNonce();
console.log(nonce.toNumber());

const nonceKey = 10;
const nonce = await biconomySmartAccount.getNonce(nonceKey);
```

**Parameters**

- nonceKey(`number`): one can also pass the optional parameter nonceKey in the case of two-dimensional nonces.

**Returns**

- address (`Promise<BigNumber>`): A Promise resolving to current nonce of the smart account.

### index

This is used to retrieve the index of the current active smart account.

**Usage**

```jsx
const index = smartAccount.index;
```

**Returns**

- index (`number`): A number indicating the index of current active smart account.

## Transaction Methods

### sendTransaction( )

This method is used to Send a transaction to a bundler for execution. It internally executes a build and send UserOp.

**Usage**

```tsx
import { createClient } from "viem";
import { createSmartAccountClient, PaymasterMode } from "@biconomy/account";
import { createWalletClient, http } from "viem";
import { polygonMumbai } from "viem/chains";

const signer = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: polygonMumbai,
  transport: http(),
});

const smartWallet = await createSmartAccountClient({ signer, bundlerUrl }); // Retrieve bundler url from dasboard
const encodedCall = encodeFunctionData({
  abi: parseAbi(["function safeMint(address to) public"]),
  functionName: "safeMint",
  args: ["0x..."],
});

const transaction = {
  to: nftAddress,
  data: encodedCall,
};

const { waitForTxHash } = await smartWallet.sendTransaction(transaction);
const { transactionHash, userOperationReceipt } = await wait();
```

**Parameters**

- manyOrOneTransactions (`Transaction | Transaction[]`, required): An array of transactions to be batched which will be executed in the provided order. You can also pass a single transaction.

  ```ts
  Transaction: {
    to: string;
  } & ValueOrData
  ```

- buildUseropDto (`BuildUserOpOptions`, optional): These options can be passed to customize how a userOp is built.

  ```ts
  type BuildUserOpOptions = {
    overrides?: Overrides;
    params?: ModuleInfo;
    nonceOptions?: NonceOptions;
    forceEncodeForBatch?: boolean;
    paymasterServiceData?: SponsorUserOperationDto;
  };
  ```

  Let's look at each of these params:

  1. overrides (`Overrides`): one can override any of the values of the userOp when it is being constructed.

     ```ts
     type BigNumberish = BigNumber | Bytes | bigint | string | number;

     type Overrides = {
       callGasLimit?: BigNumberish;
       verificationGasLimit?: BigNumberish;
       preVerificationGas?: BigNumberish;
       maxFeePerGas?: BigNumberish;
       maxPriorityFeePerGas?: BigNumberish;
       paymasterData?: string;
       signature?: string;
     };
     ```

  2. Gasless Paymaster Flow (All Methods Gasless on Dashboard): Here's how you can configure it:

  ```typescript
  let partialUserOp = await biconomySmartAccount.buildUserOp([transaction], {
    paymasterServiceData: {
      mode: PaymasterMode.SPONSORED,
    },
  });
  ```

  2. Mixed or Non-Gasless Transactions: In scenarios where you have mixed transactions (some are gasless and some are not) or all transactions are not gasless, it's more efficient to estimate gas using the bundler first. After building the user operation, you should then call getPaymasterAndData to finalize the gas parameters.

  ```typescript
  let userOp = await biconomySmartAccount.buildUserOp([transaction]);
  // ...After building user operation, proceed to get Paymaster and Data as needed
  ```

  3. params (`ModuleInfo`): This param can be used to pass session validation module parameters. Refer to the tutorial to learn more about the session keys.

     ```ts
     type ModuleInfo = {
       sessionID?: string;
       sessionSigner?: Signer;
       sessionValidationModule?: string;
       additionalSessionData?: string;
       batchSessionParams?: SessionParams[];
     };
     ```

  4. nonceOptions(`NonceOptions`) : This can be used to execute multiple user operations in parallel for the same smart account.

     ```ts
     type NonceOptions = {
       nonceKey?: number;
       nonceOverride?: number;
     };
     // nonceOptions usage
     let i = 0;
     const userOp = await smartAccount.buildUserOp([tx1], {
       nonceOptions: { nonceKey: i++ },
     });
     ```

     nonceKey can be initialised at any arbitrary number and incremented as one builds user operations to be sent in parallel. The nonceKey will create a batch or space in which the nonce can safely increment without colliding with other transactions. The nonceOverride will directly override the nonce and should only be used if you know the order in which you are sending the userOps.

  5. forceEncodeForBatch (`boolean`): When a transactions array is passed, by default the Biconomy SDK encodes it for executeBatch() executor function and execute() function for single transaction. However, in some cases, there may be a preference to encode a single transaction for a batch, especially if the custom module only decodes for executeBatch. In such cases, set this flag to true; otherwise, it remains false by default.

  6. paymasterServiceData (`SponsorUserOperationDto`): The `paymasterServiceData` includes details about the kind of sponsorship and payment token in case mode is ERC20. It contains information about the paymaster service, which is used to calculate the `paymasterAndData` field in the user operation. Note that this is only applicable if you're using Biconomy paymaster.

     ```ts
     type SponsorUserOperationDto = {
       mode: PaymasterMode;
       calculateGasLimits?: boolean; //this flag defaults to true, signifying the paymaster will undertake gas limit calculations to ensure efficient operation execution
       expiryDuration?: number;
       webhookData?: Record<string, any>;
       smartAccountInfo?: SmartAccountData;
       feeTokenAddress?: string;
     };
     ```

     It also contains optional fields such as `webhookData` and `smartAccountInfo`.

**Returns**

- userOpResponse (`Promise<UserOpResponse>`): userOpResponse that you can use to track user operation.

### buildUserOp( )

This method is used for configuring and setting up properties of the partial `userOp` object. It converts an individual transaction or batch of transactions into a partial user operation populating fields such as initCode, sender, nonce, maxFeePerGas, maxPriorityFeePerGas, callGasLimit, verificationGasLimit and preVerificationGas (as this step also involves estimating gas for the userOp internally)

**Usage**

For example, in the context of creating a userOp for an `addComment` transaction, an instance of the contract is created. A basic transaction object is then created that holds the necessary address and data from the transaction. Finally, a partial userOp is created using the Smart Account's `buildUserOp` method⁠. Now this can be signed and sent to the bundler.

```jsx
const contractAddress = "contract address";
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("rpc url");

const blogContract = new ethers.Contract(
  contractAddress,
  abi, // contract abi
  provider
);

const createComment = await blogContract.populateTransaction.addComment(
  "comment"
);

const tx1 = {
  to: contractAddress,
  data: createComment.data,
};

const userOp = await smartAccount.buildUserOp([tx1]);
```

**Parameters**

- transactions (`Transaction[]`, required): The required argument is an array of transactions which will be executed in provided order. You can pass multiple transactions into a userOp if you would like to batch them together into one transaction.
- buildUseropDto (`BuildUserOpOptions`): One can also pass these options to customize how a userOp is built.

**Returns**

- partialUserOp (`Promise<Partial<UserOperationStruct>>`): A Promise resolving to `UserOperationStruct` which can be further signed and sent to the bundler.

### senduserOp( )

This method is used to submit a User Operation object to the User Operation pool of the client. It signs the UserOperation using activeValidationModule instance and submits it to the bundler for on-chain processing.

**Usage**

```ts
const userOp = await smartAccount.buildUserOp([transaction]);
const userOpResponse = await smartAccount.sendUserOp(userOp);

const { receipt } = await userOpResponse.wait(1);
```

**Parameters**

- userOp (`Partial<UserOperationStruct>`, required): The `userOp` object includes essential fields like `sender`, `nonce`, `callData`, `callGasLimit` and `gas` related properties.

- params (`SendUserOpParams`, optional): This gets used when the active validation module is complex and requires additional information for signature generation. The `SendUserOpParams` object can contain fields such as `sessionID`, `sessionSigner`, `sessionValidationModule`, `additionalSessionData`, `batchSessionParams`, and `simulationType`. These parameters are used to customize the behavior of the `sendUserOp` method and are optional.
  ```ts
  const userOpResponse = await moduleSmartAccount?.sendUserOp(userOp, {
    sessionSigner: sessionSigner,
    sessionValidationModule: moduleAddr,
  });
  ```
  Similar to building a `userOp` we need to ensure that any modules used for additional validation or execution logic are specified in the `sendUserOp` method. Currently, this only applies for session key module requirements.

:::note
Please note that `simulationType` allows for more debugging insights about `callData` on why an internal transaction fails. It is set to "validation" by default, but can be changed to "validation_and_execution" for more detailed tracing.
:::

**Returns**

- userOpsResponse (`UserOpResponse`): The method returns an object of type `UserOpResponse` which has a `userOpHash` and two methods: `wait()` and `waitForTxHash()`.

  ```ts
  type UserOpResponse = {
    userOpHash: string;
    wait(_confirmations?: number): Promise<UserOpReceipt>;
    waitForTxHash(): Promise<UserOpStatus>;
  };

  type UserOpReceipt = {
    userOpHash: string;
    entryPoint: string;
    sender: string;
    nonce: number;
    paymaster: string;
    actualGasCost: BigNumber;
    actualGasUsed: BigNumber;
    success: boolean;
    reason: string;
    logs: Array<ethers.providers.Log>;
    receipt: ethers.providers.TransactionReceipt;
  };
  ```

  The `wait()` method resolves when the user operation is dispatched by the bundler on-chain and gets mined. The `waitForTxHash()` method returns a `UserOpStatus` object which includes the transaction hash and the receipt once added on-chain.

### sendSignedUserOp( )

This method is designed to dispatch signed user operations to the bundler.
This method is particularly useful when handling operations that have been grouped together with a multi-chain module, as it allows for the submission of these combined operations in a single request. It can also be useful in the case of two different instances of smart account, for example one backend instance to build userOp, while another instance to obtain the signed userOp on the frontend and subsequently dispatch the signed userOp using the backend instance.

**Usage**

```ts
const userOpResponse = await smartAccount.sendSignedUserOp(userOp);
```

:::note
Please ensure that the user operations have been correctly signed before using this method⁠
:::
**Parameters**

- userOp (`UserOperation`, required): The `userOp` object includes essential fields like `sender`, `nonce`, `callData`, `gas` related properties, and `signature`.

- params (`SendUserOpParams`): The `SendUserOpParams` object can contain fields such as `sessionID`, `sessionSigner`, `sessionValidationModule`, `additionalSessionData`, `batchSessionParams`, and `simulationType`. These parameters are used to customize the behavior of the `sendUserOp` method and are optional.

**Returns**

- userOpsResponse (`UserOpResponse`): The method returns an object of type `UserOpResponse` which has a `userOpHash` and two methods: `wait()` and `waitForTxHash()`.
  The `wait()` method resolves when the user operation is dispatched by the bundler on-chain and gets mined. The `waitForTxHash()` method returns a `UserOpStatus` object which includes the transaction hash and the receipt once added on-chain.
