title: Gas Estimations SDK
---

The Gas estimation SDK enables you to estimate gas limits accurately. This functionality is packaged within an npm package, enabling other infrastructure providers to reuse the same logic.

While sending a userOp, it is essential to accurately estimate callGasLimit, verificationGasLimit and preVerificationGas. This ensures the userOp is included on the chain.
The exact definition of these values is mentioned in the ERC 4337 spec [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#useroperation).

Accurately estimating gas limits is crucial, as failure to do so may result in the following scenarios:

- If preVerificationGas is not enough the userOp can be rejected by bundlers
- If callGasLimit is not enough the transaction will be included on-chain but the call data execution will not be completed and the paymaster or account will still pay for the userOp
- If verificationGasLimit is low the userOp will revert to the simulation step

All the above problems result in bad UX, failed and reverted transactions which are also hard to debug.
