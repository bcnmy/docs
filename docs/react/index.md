# Hooks

Biconomy delivers a great developer experience through modular and composable APIs, automatic type safety and inference, and comprehensive documentation.

Biconomy's useAA supports the most popular and commonly-used Account Abstraction features out of the box with more than 10 React Hooks for transaction sponsorship, batching, session management, gas estimations, and more.

If you need lower-level control, you can always drop down to our [core SDK](https://github.com/bcnmy/biconomy-client-sdk), which [useAA](https://github.com/bcnmy/useAA) uses internally to perform AA operations.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
