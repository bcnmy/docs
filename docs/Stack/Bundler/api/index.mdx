You can get your Bundler URL from the Biconomy [Dashboard](https://dashboard.biconomy.io/bundlers).
This is the same endpoint URL used for all the networks.
All requests must follow the [JSON RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specifications.

:::info
This documentation is for using our Bundler API directly. If you are building with the Biconomy SDK you can follow the instructions on this [page](/stack/bundler/bundlermethods).

You can test these endpoints on our [Bundler Explorer](/stack/bundler/api/explorer).
