# Common Errors

We are sorry to cause any inconvenience while interacting with biconomy SDK. We are trying our best to send meaningful error messages that can help you do quick fixes without interacting with any support channel. Some of the error messages are not in our control as we are using some standard contract ( e.g EntryPoint ) to provider gasless experience. Following are some standard error messages that can help you apply quick fixes and sort the issues.

Ensure that you are using the bundler, paymaster, and RPC URL of the same blockchain.

Ensure you are using the same signer, you created the account with. If the error persists, try simulating `validateUserOp` method on entrypoint contract with the user operation on [tenderly](https://tenderly.co/). Also ensure, if sender has sufficient native tokens to cover the User Operation's gas costs. If you are using paymaster to sponsor the transactions, ensure that the paymasterAndData field of the user operation is correctly set to enable proper handling of gas fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
