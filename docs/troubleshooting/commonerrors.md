# Common Errors

We are sorry to cause any inconvenience while interacting with biconomy SDK. We are trying our best to send meaningful error messages that can help you do quick fixes without interacting with any support channel. Some of the error messages are not in our control as we are using some standard contract ( e.g EntryPoint ) to provider gasless experience. Following are some standard error messages that can help you apply quick fixes and sort the issues.

Ensure that you are using the bundler, paymaster, and RPC URL of the same blockchain.
