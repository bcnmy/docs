[Read more about Distributed Keys here](../../../Modules/sessions/DistributedSessions)

:::info 
These helpers are a beta feature and are subject to change. To use this feature use our beta package `@biconomy-devx/account` instead of `@biconomy/account`, add the following bunfig.toml configuration:
```toml
[install.scopes]
silencelaboratories = { token = "$VITE_SILENCE_LABS_NPM_TOKEN", url = "https://registry.npmjs.org" }
```
And obtain the `VITE_SILENCE_LABS_NPM_TOKEN` from our support team, and add it to your .env file
:::

```ts
import { danSDK } from "@biconomy-devx/account"

const danSessionKeyPayload = await danSDK.generateSessionKey(...options);
const signature = await danSDK.signMessage("My message", ...moreOptions);
```

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
